4. **Use one-time** for planned maintenance projects
5. **Assign income to owners** to track who contributes what
6. **Expand monthly breakdown** to spot cash flow problems

## What's Different from Bókhald?

| Rekstraráætlun (Budget) | Bókhald (Ledger) |
|------------------------|------------------|
| **Planning** | **Reality** |
| Predictable recurring costs | Actual transactions |
| Expected income | Real income received |
| Does NOT affect balance | DOES affect balance |
| Monthly contributions plan | Guest payments, repairs |
| Forward-looking | Historical |

**Example**: 
- **Budget**: "We expect 300k kr in electricity costs"
- **Ledger**: "We paid 350k kr in electricity this year" (broken AC)

The **Variance Widget** shows the difference!

2. ✅ Adjust income/expenses as needed
